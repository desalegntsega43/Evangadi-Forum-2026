Overview
The Evangadi Forum backend is a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js. It provides endpoints for user authentication, question management, answer management, and AI-powered chatbot functionality.

Tech Stack:

Node.js with Express.js
MySQL database
JWT for authentication
Groq API (Llama 3.3) for AI chatbot
Multer for file uploads
Nodemailer for email services
Authentication
Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
Token Expiration: 1 day

How to Get a Token
Register a new user: POST /api/user/register
Login: POST /api/user/login
Use the returned token in subsequent requests
Environment Variables

# Database Configuration
HOST=localhost
USER=your_mysql_username
PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
DATABASE=your_database_name

# Server Configuration
PORT=5500

# JWT Secret
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Groq API (for AI chatbot)
